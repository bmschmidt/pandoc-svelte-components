# Custom behavior for classes.

Different document. The example file here applies highlight.js classes to elements,
and then looks at the codeblock class for custom actions.

R code may be destined for R Markdown, so we'll make all R code copy to R markdown blocks.

```R

r_code %>%
   is_made %>%
   of_pipes %>%
   that_can %>%
   wrap_around %>%
   and_you_just_paste_them_in

```

Indentation is important to python, so every python block gets buttons to change the indenting.

```python

python = "a language_where"
  "indentation really matters"
  "for copying."

```

Javascript code can be executed straight in the browser: I can't think
of any reason not to do that!

```js
alert('Usage of eval is a bad idea!');
```
