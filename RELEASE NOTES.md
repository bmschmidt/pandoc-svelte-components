# 0.1.0

- Sveltekit 1.0 compatibility!
- Started adding some additional code to silence warnings.

# 0.0.7

- Allow custom passed instances to be class specific, so that you can override just (say) `Div.slide` instead of
  overriding every case of `Div`. This is really useful!

# 0.0.6

- Update to most recent svelte-kit for builds
- Add preliminary scaffolding for built-in wasm version.

# 0.0.5

- Add RawInline and RawBlock examples
- Change export settings.

# 0.0.3

- Multiple scrollership components, including buttons, buttonsets, etc.
- Header bar with controls for toggling.

# 0.0.2

- Add fully integrated integrated example of 'scrollership' to library under scrollership elements.
- Show pandoc call in scrollership example because only having compiled
  JSON in examples doesn't give a sense of how this actually works.
- Add Newline element to core pandoc elements.
